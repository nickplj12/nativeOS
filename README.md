Welcome to nativeOS! 

> An OS inside an OS, basically..

# Setup
GitHub wouldn't let me upload mre than 100 files and the git command line seems to complicated sooo..

1. Download [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/)
2. Download package.json
3. Download system.html
4. Put package.json and system.html both in your NW.js folder
5. Launch nw.exe or whatever you named it.
